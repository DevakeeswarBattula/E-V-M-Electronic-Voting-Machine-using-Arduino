# E-V-M-Electronic-Voting-Machine-using-Arduino
In this project we have used four push buttons for four different candidates. We can increase the number of candidate but for better understanding we have limited it to four. When any voter press any of four button then respecting voting value will increment by one each time. After whole voting we will press result button to see the results. As the "result" button is pressed, arduino calculates the total votes of each candidate and show it on LCD display.
